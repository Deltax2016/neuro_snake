# Snake Neural Network Trainer

## ATTENTION: The main project now in easy_learn
![Alt text](images/image.png?raw=true "Title")

This project is designed to train a neural network to play the popular game of Snake. The project contains a sandbox for training the snake neural network (game.py), an environment for running the snake neural network (game_auto.py), and three different versions of the neural network (snake_nn.py, snake_nn_2.py, snake_nn_3.py). The neural network is implemented using numpy and the graphics are also generated using numpy.

## Requirements

This project uses numpy for both the neural network and graphics. You will need to have numpy installed in your environment to run this project.

## Installation

You can install numpy using pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Files

- `game.py`: This is the sandbox file. You can use this file to train your snake neural network.
- `game_auto.py`: This is the environment file. After training your snake neural network, you can use this file to run it.
- `snake_nn.py`: This is the first version of the neural network.
- `snake_nn_2.py`: This is the second version of the neural network.
- `snake_nn_3.py`: This is the third version of the neural network.

## Usage

To train the neural network, run the game.py file:

```bash
python game.py
```



To run the trained neural network, use the game_auto.py file:

```bash
python game_auto.py
```

This will run the game using the second version of the neural network.
